Simple, ultra-lightweight neofetch clone for Windows 10+ written in C++ and installable through winget(?). The executable is just under 70KB and requires absolutely no dependencies

Note: source code relies on C++20 features, if you wish to build it from source, use C++20 or later, otherwise it will NOT compile
